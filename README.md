# Encryptions

This repository provides implementations of various encryption algorithms for study and experimentation purposes. It is designed to help learners and developers understand, use, and extend classic and modern cryptographic techniques.

## Overview

The project is structured to include multiple encryption algorithms, focusing on ciphers and other types. Each algorithm is implemented for clarity and educational value, making it easy to study, modify, and extend. More algorithms will be added over time.

## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceasor-elvis/Encryptions.git
cd Encryptions
```

## Supported Algorithms

- Affine Cipher (Python)
- Caesar Cipher (Python, JavaScript)

## Planned Algorithms & Extensions

- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Substitution Cipher
- Transposition Cipher
- Modern encryption types (e.g., AES, RSA)
- More cipher types and cryptographic primitives

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own directory under `Ciphers/`. You can study the code, run the scripts, or use them as a basis for your own projects.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an algorithm to add or an improvement to suggest, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
